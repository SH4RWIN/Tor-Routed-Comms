### High-Level Project Plan: AI-Assisted Secure Messenger

This plan outlines the key phases for developing your secure communication channel, starting with a strong cryptographic foundation and progressively adding layers of anonymity and features.

### **Phase 1: Core Cryptographic Engine & E2EE**

*Goal: Create a functional client-server chat application where all communication is end-to-end encrypted and the server is blind to message content.*

- **Task 1.1: Architecture Scaffolding.**
    - Set up a basic client and server application using a suitable language (e.g., Go, Rust, or Python).
    - Define the basic protocol for client registration, login, and message sending.
- **Task 1.2: Implement the Signal Protocol.**
    - Integrate a well-vetted library that implements the Signal Protocol (e.g., `libsignal`).
    - Implement the X3DH handshake for initial key agreement between users.
    - Implement the Double Ratchet algorithm for ongoing message encryption. The server's role is simply to store and forward the encrypted "blobs" of data (pre-key bundles, encrypted messages) without having keys to read them.
- **Task 1.3: Specify Cryptographic Primitives.**
    - **Symmetric Encryption:** AES-256 in GCM mode.
    - **Key Exchange:** Curve25519 (X25519).
    - **Hashing:** SHA-512.
    - **Signatures:** Ed25519.

### **Phase 2: Anonymity and Transport Security**

*Goal: Hide the server's location and add a layer of transport security over the anonymous connection.*

- **Task 2.1: Configure the Server as a Tor Onion Service.**
    - Install and configure the Tor daemon on your server.
    - Set up the `torrc` configuration file to create a hidden service, which will generate your `.onion` address.
- **Task 2.2: Client-Side Tor Integration.**
    - The client application must be configured to route its traffic through the Tor network to connect to the `.onion` address. This can be done by bundling a Tor client or by instructing the user to connect through the Tor Browser's SOCKS proxy.
- **Task 2.3: Implement TLS over Tor.**
    - Generate a self-signed TLS certificate for your `.onion` address. Since `.onion` addresses are not part of the traditional DNS, you cannot get a certificate from a standard Certificate Authority.
    - Configure your server to only accept TLS connections.
    - The client must be configured to trust this specific self-signed certificate (certificate pinning) to prevent MITM attacks.

### **Phase 3: Secure AI Integration**

*Goal: Add AI functionality without compromising the security model.*

- **Task 3.1: Research and Select a Self-Hostable LLM.**
    - Evaluate open-source models based on performance, resource requirements, and licensing (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, Phi-3).
- **Task 3.2: Implement a Secure AI Query Handler.**
    - **Option A (Most Secure): Client-Side AI.** The client application that types `@ai_name` runs a local instance of the AI model. It generates a response and posts it to the channel as a normal, E2EE message from a special "AI user." This is highly secure but resource-intensive for the user.
    - **Option B (Server-Side AI):** The server runs the AI model. When a client sends an AI query, the client encrypts the query with a special key known only to that client and the server's AI module (not the general message router). The server's AI module decrypts it, processes it, and sends the encrypted response back to the client to be posted in the channel. This is a complex but viable model that prevents the server's message-routing logic from seeing the AI content.

### **Phase 4: Security Hardening**

*Goal: Add advanced features to protect against sophisticated adversaries and future threats.*

- **Task 4.1: Implement Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography.**
    - Integrate PQC libraries for CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium.
    - Modify your key exchange and signature schemes to be hybrid, combining the outputs of both classical and PQC algorithms.
- **Task 4.2: Add Metadata Resistance.**
    - Implement message padding to standardize the length of all encrypted packets sent to the server.
- **Task 4.3: Build User-Friendly Key Verification.**
    - Develop the UI/UX for displaying safety numbers and/or QR codes.
    - Add clear "unverified" warnings to the user interface.

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Usability**

*Goal: Make the server easy for anyone to deploy and manage.*

- **Task 5.1: Containerize the Server Application.**
    - Create a `Dockerfile` for your server application.
    - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines the services for your application, the Tor daemon, and potentially the self-hosted AI model. This will allow anyone to deploy the entire system with a single `docker-compose up` command.
- **Task 5.2: Documentation.**
    - Write clear, step-by-step documentation for setting up the server, connecting as a client, and verifying contacts.
